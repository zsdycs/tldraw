You can customize tldraw's main menu.

The main menu contains important submenus: Edit, Shape, Preferences etc. To open the main menu, click the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the tldraw component. It can be customized by providing a `MainMenu` component to the `Tldraw` component's `components` prop. If you provide `null`, then that component will be hidden.
