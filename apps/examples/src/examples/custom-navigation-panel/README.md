You can customize tldraw's navigation panel or remove it entirely.

---

The navigation panel is in the bottom left of the tldraw component at larger breakpoints. It contains zoom controls and a mini map. It can be customized by providing a `NavigationPanel` component to the `Tldraw` component's `components` prop. If you provide `null`, then that component will be hidden instead.
